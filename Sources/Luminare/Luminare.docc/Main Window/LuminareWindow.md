# ``Luminare/LuminareWindow``

This provides an out-of-the-box experience for marching your design coherently using ``Luminare``.

It has traffic lights but without a title bar section, while the window content are wrapped within a ``LuminareView``.

Typically, you are likely to put a ``LuminareDividedStack`` inside, resulting in a vertically divided layout:

![`LuminareWindow`](LuminareWindow)
